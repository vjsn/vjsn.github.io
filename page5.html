Ever since the invention of the Single Lens Reflex (SLR) camera, its usage has long been associated within the realm of journalistic photography and from there, spread to overtake and eventually displace the usage of the mirrorless rangefinder camera. One that had previously been dominated by it since the first 35mm camera (Leica I) was invented by Oskar Barnack.</div><div><br></div><div>This had been due to the fact that the SLR was able to show the photographer an accurate representation of what would be captured through its optical viewfinder (OVF). This has kept true in the transition to the digital age, as early mirrorless digital cameras had poor displays unable to represent faithfully the scene being captured.
</div><div>
</div><div>When the digital age came, Digital SLRs became the dominant force in professional photography, with pros preferring their rugged build quality and tried and true, ergonomic form factors refined by decades of continuous research and development.
</div><div>
</div><div>Meanwhile their more compact, mirrorless brethren have been mostly relegated to amateur status due to the absence of an OVF, lack of build and image quality, poor ergonomics and autofocus performance that prevent them from seeing widespread adoption by professionals.
</div><div>
</div><div>However the market has recently seen mirrorless sales surge as enthusiasts and amateurs alike have grown weary of hauling heavy dSLRs around when oftentimes, a more compact, mirrorless model would suffice and present similar quality results.
</div><div>
</div><div>With the advent of large sensors in mirrorless cameras, image quality could finally rival those of dSLRs. This along with the adoption electronic viewfinder (EVF) finally had the majority of amateurs jumping ship to mirrorless interchangeable lens cameras (MILCs). 
</div><div>
</div><div>Nevertheless, professionals remained steadfast in their use of the dSLR as mirrorless cameras simply had not caught up with the dSLR in the areas that mattered to them, namely ergonomics, build quality, autofocus performance, and lens selection.
</div><div>
</div><div>This is changing.
</div><div>
</div><div>Companies such as Sony and Fujifilm have been pumping new models at breakneck speed. With improvements coming at a similar pace, it won’t be long until they catch up to Canikon. In some cases even, they have surpassed them. 
</div><div>
</div><div>Fujifilm’s latest X-T1 body for one offers a stellar ergonomic SLR-style body, fast phase-detect autofocus (PDAF) akin to those found in dSLRs, weather resistance on par with Canikon bodies, and a large 2.36 million dot EVF that rivals traditional OVFs in quality and bests them in size with a massive .77x magnification ratio.
</div><div>
</div><div>Should these nimble mirrorless companies continue to innovate and improve their products at the speed at which they have been, these new breed of professional-grade mirrorless cameras could soon overtake and replace dSLRs in professional use, just as they have in the amateur space, and just as SLRs have replaced the mirrorless rangefinders of yore.
</div><div>
</div><div>However, SLRs as a whole will never truly die out, perhaps pushed aside. There will always be a market for nostalgia. Just ask Leica, they’ve been doing rather well for a company whose revenue is mostly from sales of manual-focusing rangefinders.
</div><div>
</div><div>But make no mistake, mirrorless is here to stay.
