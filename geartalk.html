            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7">Why I Love the Fujifilm X-T1
<div>
</div><div>When Fujifilm unveiled the X-T1, I was ecstatic. Amazed. Brimming with joy. 
</div><div>
</div><div>It was the most beautiful thing I laid eyes upon. It was gorgeous. It still is.
</div><div>
</div><div>So it was around 2014 and I was looking for a new, smaller, mirrorless camera to complement my aging full frame dSLR, the Canon 5D Mark II (which was and still is by the way a great camera) because I simply didn’t want to haul all that heavy gear when I’m out and about travelling with friends. Because like it or not, it gets fiddly juggling huge L lenses between your bag and camera trying to get that perfect shot.
</div><div>
</div><div>I needed something light and portable with great image quality. I would’ve settled for anything lighter than my 5D, with one catch. It had to take stunning pictures.
</div><div>
</div><div>Back then there were a couple of options to choose from. There were the Micro Four Thirds (MFT) cameras from Olympus and Panasonic, the Alpha (formerly NEX) lineup from Sony, and the lacklustre Canon EOS M and Nikon 1s that I didn’t even consider. 
</div><div>
</div><div>Initially what appealed to me the most were the Sony Alpha 7 lineup, they were full frame, had great image quality supposedly and they’re made by Sony. I loved Sony, I still do. The MFT cameras were in the running for me but I was afraid that it’d be too far a step down from full-frame (looking back on it that is kinda a non-issue).
</div><div>
</div><div>I was dead-set on the Sony. I loved the company, I loved the design, I loved the photos that came out of it. 
</div><div>
</div><div>Then Fujifilm announced the X-T1 and my jaw hit the floor.
</div><div>
</div><div>It was unlike anything I’ve ever seen. It had a retro design, those beautiful tactile dials, lots of those dials. It was a product made by a company I had long associated with great photography (if anyone remembers the good old days of Fujifilm film), and it was a bargain! They were a few hundred dollars cheaper than the A7 when it launched so I said why not.
</div><div>
</div><div>Now for the actual review part, got a wee bit carried away right there.
</div><div>
</div><div>So over the years that I’ve used the Fujifilm X-T1, the thing that I’ve come to appreciate the most about it is probably still the design. It’s perfectly ergonomic for me (people with bigger hands might disagree, but I beg to differ), those dials make adjusting the exposure triangle so convenient, as opposed to the fiddly dials on my 5D. Plus I can change settings while the camera is off, just like the good old days on my FM2n.
</div><div>
</div><div>Image quality is amazing simply put. I thought I was I was in for a downgrade in that department being that the 5DII had more megapixels, 5.1 more to be exact, but the X-T1 held its own like a champ. In my travels, the pictures I’ve taken on the X-T1 were more than sharp enough when printed, let alone viewed on a computer monitor. When paired with the XF56 1.2, the X-T1 more than held its own in portraits against the 5DII with a EF50 1.2
</div><div>
</div><div>Taking the Fuji to the fields was no issue either, it’s burst rate of 8fps was more than enough for me, being that I put up with the 5DIIs meager 3.9fps burst.
</div><div>
</div><div>In my experience, the Fuji hunted a bit more when focusing compared to the Canon, especially in low light. But when it did lock focus, it was accurate 100% of the time. While I often misfocused with the 5D’s primitive (even at the time of its launch) AF system. The X-T1 always gave me reliable autofocus with its phase-detect system. The manufacturer’s claims of 0.08 seconds were valid, provided that it was in good light. The EVF also helped in confirming focus much better than the OVF on my dSLR did, it’s also much brighter and larger, though it does sap the battery when it’s on.
</div><div>
</div><div>Compared to the Canon, the X-T1 is way lighter, my back has never felt less sore in years. Though its weight or more precisely, lack of weight, made me worry a bit with regards to its durability and reliability and extreme conditions.
</div><div>
</div><div>I had shot on the 5D in heavy rain and it came out unscathed. At first, I would’ve never taken the X-T1 out under similar conditions, but over time - I got over my fears of damaging it and safe to say, it performed admirably under varying conditions. 
</div><div>
</div><div>I’ve taken the X-T1 to shoot under a waterfall and the camera came out fine. A bit wet outside, but dry as the Sahara inside.
</div><div>
</div><div>The chassis is also in my opinion, durable. I had once dropped the camera on a hard ceramic surface, and while the camera came out unscathed, let’s say the floor wasn’t as lucky… I’ve never dropped the 5DII though so I can’t speak the same for it. So yeah, it’s tough alright, and Fuji did a great job at sealing it from the elements, even though it has more flippy parts for water to theoretically enter.
</div><div>
</div><div>I have very few complaints for this camera really. While pros might complain about the lack of a second slot, and the video crowd about the lack of 4K and a fully articulating screen, I don’t really have a problem with that since the 5DII has neither of those features and I’ve been perfectly content, being that I don’t need the redundancy or the video features. 
</div><div>
</div><div>However, the one feature that I do miss is the joystick for af point selection. It just feels weird and “off” to use the dpad to select focus, especially since the buttons are so recessed and below where my thumb naturally rests.
</div><div>
</div><div>Save to say, the X-T2 and now X-T3 fix all those aforementioned issues so by the time I upgrade, I’ll be on my way to having the perfect camera.
</div><div>
</div><div>But really though, the X-T1 is as close to perfect as I’ve had.

It combines the ergonomics of an SLR style design with the weight and size savings of a mirrorless camera. It has a PDAF focusing system and a huge .77x EVF that bests most dSLRs OVFs. Also, it has an improved version of the X-Trans sensor that was found in the X-Pro 1</p>
