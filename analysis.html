                <h2 class="align-center pb-3 mbr-fonts-style display-2"><strong>Analysis of Article</strong></h2>
                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>Although </strong>both the original press release by Fujifilm and the recast article are meant to promote their respective subjects, and thus feature positive lexis such as “stellar” in the recast and “perfect” in the original. However, since the press release is written by the manufacturer itself, who has a vested interest in seeing the product succeed and pride in their product, the positive lexis featured in the original are almost entirely made up of superlatives such as “fastest”, “smoothest”, and “purest”. Meanwhile, the recast is more reserved in its praise of mirrorless camera; with “stellar” being one of the only full praise directed at the mirrorless camera, as its purpose is not to promote but to inform.<br><br>
<div>
</div><div><strong>Comparatively</strong>, there are plenty more instances of hedges being used in the article than in the press release “should”, “perhaps”, and “could” vs “almost” in the original press release. This is due to the fact that author does not know what would happen in the future and thus hedges in order to prevent a potentially incorrect statement from being made. In contrast, Fujifilm knows exactly what the X-T1 is capable of and thus only hedges in this case “almost any shooting assignment” to gloss over the fact that it can’t shoot in certain conditions.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>While there can be seen</strong> the use of photographic jargon in both texts such as “SLR”, “EVF”, and “MILC”, in the article, the aforementioned jargons are expanded upon as the author doesn’t expect every visitor to know what they mean, as it is one targeted to a general audience and not just photographers. In contrast, since the only people that’d be reading the Fujifilm press release are likely to be people interested in photography and thus the X-T1, they do not explain basic terms such as those as they would rightly assume that the audience understands them.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>Furthermore</strong>, while both texts have a relatively professional semi-formal register, the press release is more-so. This is because the press release by nature is a more serious document meant primarily for journalists (and bloggers like me) to get information about the product to write articles about, whereas the article on my blog is meant for ordinary people like you and me and so features colloquialisms such as “Canikon” and “hauling” that would be wholly inappropriate if found in the press release.

                    Analysis of Review</strong></h2>
                <h3 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-light mbr-fonts-style display-7"><strong>While both</strong> the review and press release both serve the purpose of promoting Fujifilm’s X-T1, they are written differently. The press release is entirely written in the third person as being an official source, it has to maintain some semblance of objectivity, while the review is written entirely in the first person “I” as it is meant to be the personal subjective opinion of the author regarding the Fujifilm X-T1. However ironically, it is the review that ends up being the more objective piece, while the press release exaggerates the quality of the camera through its overuse of superlatives such as “ultimate” that makes bias evident.<br><br><div><strong>In line with this</strong> thought, the press release contains no pejorative lexis whatsoever, only covering the positive aspects of the camera. While the review also does not use pejorative lexis when describing the X-T1, there is usage of negative language such as “meager” to lambast what it was being compared to; the 5DII, which in effect makes the X-T1 look positive, thus generating a similar effect.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>Due to the difference</strong> in the level of formality between the press release, there are present features in the review that aren’t in the press release like figurative language such as “my jaw hit the floor” as it wouldn’t be an appropriate display of professionalism, or more accurately, a lack of one. However, the press release does incorporate hyperbole when stating “controls can be reached in an instant” that is slightly misleading; which carries a similar effect of showing how good the camera is.</div><br><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>Additionally</strong>, there is a difference in the tense used in the review and press release. The review is written mostly in past tense “was”, while shifting to present tense “I do miss” near the end as it recounts the author’s past experiences with the camera and his current thoughts on it. While the press release on the other hand is written in present tense as it was released concurrently with the unveiling of the camera, and details its current (not past) capabilities.
